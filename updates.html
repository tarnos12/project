    <h3>Patch notes 1.7.3</h3>
    <h4 class="green">Additions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Item tooltip, now display values gained(green), lost(red), not changed(blue) when hovering over an item. This should make it easier to equip best item you can.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="orange">Changes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Turn based combat, your weapon skills need to be used during combat, this is early version of combat, so it is not finished yet, but it should work :)
        </li>
        <li>
            Removed auto battle, due to new combat(might be added later on).
        </li>
        <li>
            Overall, changed all weapon skill stats.
        </li>
        <li>
            Health regen, works only in battle(per turn), after a battle your health will be full again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increased height of inventory, this will prevent page moving up while you sell items, which caused you to missclick and equip items. This problem is still there, if you have a lot items in your inventory and you sell them from the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>
            Moved some stuff around, put donation button to a visible spot(it was there for a long long time, but well hidden lol).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="red">Bug Fixes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            As always, some bugs were fixed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Patch notes 1.7.2</h3>
    <h4 class="green">Additions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Added "prestige", after defeating last enemy on the map(once), all enemies will be empowered, and you will need to fight your way from the first enemy.
            All items, crafting, enemy stats will get multiplied by prestige level, so first prestige gives 2x multiplier, then 3x/4x and so on forever...
        </li>
        <li>
            Added reset button(after beating last enemy), so you can reset whenever you want.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added error tracking, which will let me see all errors you have during the game. So far most of them are caused by OLD SAVES(You need to reset them at starting page).  
            I will be removing all saves manually soon, as it seems not everyone knows that :| Also game version verify is not always working for some reason(probably on very old saves).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="orange">Changes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Many changes with item stats.
        </li>
        <li>
            Forced reset, since a lot of peoples had troubles with manual reset, even tho there is a button on main page to do that for you. This will hopefully fix most bugs.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="red">Bug Fixes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixed some bugs, and stuff -_-
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixed a bug which did not reset monsters kill count as supposed.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Patch notes 1.7.1</h3>
    <h4 class="green">Additions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Monster kill count below all monsters.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alt + Click = 10 stats for MAC users, Ctrl + click still works.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added 6 difficulty settings! You can switch them while you play and monsters will be updated. Monster stats will change in range 0.3 up to 5.0(that means 5x all stats/Exp too!).
        </li>
        <li>
            Added version check(again after a long time...). It will reset any save file that is too old, when you try to load it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="orange">Changes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Game balance, changed all monsters stats, player stats, item stats.
        </li>
        <li>
            Monsters unlock after 10 kills, if you fight elite/boss monster(2 last monsters of each map) it requires only 1 kill.
        </li>
        <li>
            Changed item drop stats, they should be more balanced, and less likely skyrocket in stats early in the game.
        </li>
        <li>
            Player experience required for next level updated.
        </li>
        <li>
            All races bonuses changed. Hopefully Giant/Orc will no longer be the only viable pick :)
        </li>
        <li>
            Each weapon type(Sword/Axe/Mace/Staff/Ranged) have different damage multiplier, which means that staff will roll with low damage, while axe will have high damage.
            This is a preparation for next big update which will add spells.
        </li>
        <li>
            Removed Evasion/Critical damage/Health regen/Mana regen from all items.
        </li>
        <li>
            Item stats are based on item level, unlike before they were based on a list of stats with a set range(3-8 Strength/8-15 Strength etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
            Item stats were maxed out at level 50, now you can increase them forever, as long as you can drop higher level items.
        </li>
        <li>
            You cannot select text/images or anything while playing, this will prevent accidental and annoying text selection which cannot be unselected or is hard to do so.
            You can still select your save code tho.
        </li>
        <li>
            Changed defense damage reduction, should be somehow "balanced" compared to before.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sword weapon skill, block/counter updated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Life gain on hit is no longer percentage but flat instead.
        </li>
        <li>
            Block chance is capped at 40%, sword mastery can go over this cap tho.
        </li>
        <li>
            Removed game events, need to be reworked later on.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increased base player damage by 2, to help with early leveling.
        </li>

            Sword Finesse(Sword skill), scales with agility instead of dexterity.
        </li>

            Updated all weapon skills damage.
        </li>
        <li>
            First weapon skill is available at level 1. You can use staff right away without leveling it up etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Weapon mastery starts at level 1 instead of 0.
        </li>
        <li>
            Changed difficulty setting names.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="red">Bug Fixes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixed a bug with stats, which were multiplied by 2 for some reason :|
