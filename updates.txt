_________________________
v1.3.1 - 18 march 2015   |
-------------------------|
- Hold Ctrl & click to add 10 stats, shift & click for 100 stats
- Evasion cap at 20%
- Critical chance cap at 50% from stats(will be possible to increase by other means later in the game, like skills, buffs, items)
- Moved Secondary Stats panel, and merged it together with Player Stats, so you can see both of the at the same time.
- Each item has hidden base stats(strength,endurance etc.), iLvl(item level), each monster has a level too...Combining both of those and base stats, give each item random stat each time they drop, so if you kill stronger enemy, and he drop same weapon, it will be much stronger :)
- All monster drop items of rarity common, uncommon, rare, epic(even epics yes!), but since low level monster, give weaker stats, and has lower chance to drop "epic" then it is better to kill stronger monster.
- Last monster of each area has a chance to drop "Legendary" quality items.
- Luck increase your Drop Rate, you need total of 500 luck to increase your Drop Rate by 200%, which means item which has a chance of 0.01% drop will have 0.02% drop rate. Same for 1% will change to 2%. There will be items increasing drop rate directly too.
- Removed Bestiary tab, since it was not used, but will be in the future.
- Added buy 10 and buy 100, at the shop.
- Disabled stat upgrade for Wisdom and Intelligence, since they don't have much of use right now.

- Bug Fix
_________________________
v1.3.0.1 - 12 march 2015 |
-------------------------|
- Fixed a bug, with Bow weapon skill not upgrading
_________________________
v1.3.0 - 12 march 2015   |
-------------------------|
- Redesigned item loot table, no more random stats on items. Each item has it's own name and stats, will be updated further, so each item can have higher stats(randomly)
- Game log display total damage received/dealt also critical hit rating(total critical hits divided by turns that took you to kill/die)
- Changed max turns to 20 from 19(that was a mistake actually since it was supossed to be 20). It will be changed to increase based on character stat like endurance later on
- Player stats now display STR, END etc instead of Strength, Endurance
- Moved Sell All buttons to inventory page for easy access.
- Updated item tooltip, now display only stats which are higher than 0,
- Auto save feature, save the game every 10 seconds. Remeber to load a game manually after you refresh the page.
- Added donation button at the option menu, if you want to support me feel free to donate. I want to spend some money on better graphic later on, so any amount will help.
- Each monster health is displayed, when you attack it, monster hp will not change back to max anymore. I will need to consider adding some limitations, so you can't attack stronger monster to farm items easly by fighting it 1000 times etc...
- Added a little tutorial, on the left side you will find a tab "Game info" I will be updating it with new info, currently there are just basic stuff.
- Moved Inventory tab next to Equipment tab inside Player Stats tab for easier access
- Mega potion now saves
- All potions are used automatically, when you are low enough, they are used while "auto fighting for 20 rounds" You can't see the effect in most cases, but you will notice that "total damage taken" will be lower if you have health potions.
- There is also requirement for them to be used. Read more in game<Game info tab>
- You gain stats per level, You can still spend 10 points each level(soon to be changed)
- Increased defense gain for each point in dexterity and endurance
- Increased base critical chance to 10%
- You can upgrade your Inventory slots, at shop. Each upgrade gives you + 1 inventory slots, for 100 gold at the beginning and increasing by 2 times for each purchase(just a basic idea)
- You can also buy + 1 stat points for 1000 gold at shop, price stays the same for now, might change it later
- Your max inventory slots are determined by your total strength(including bonuses from items/passives). You start with 20 slots + 1 slot for every 10 points in strength.
- Lowered all monster defense, ALOT. That should make it much easier fighting stronger enemies, with current changes, when you don't find items with + 10k stats.
- You can drop multiple items at once, if you are lucky :)
- Luck increase a chance to "roll an item". What that means is, with more luck, there is a higher chance for you to get an item from a monster, note that this does not increase actual item drop chance, but how often you will roll for that item.
- There is probably more, I can't remember now.
_________________________

_________________________
v1.2.1 - 18 february 2015|
-------------------------|
- Check options menu! You can use checkbox to set which items will be destroyed when dropped from monsters, if you dont want to see common items in your inventory, then just check a box :)
- Base drop rate is 100%. When you have 200% drop rate that means every item has 2x higher chance to drop...at some point with high enough drop Rate, common/uncommon won't drop at all, unless you already use auto destroy option :)
- With higher drop rate, you also drop items more often, base chance to drop an item is around 50%, each point in luck increase that chance by 0.01 so at 100 points of luck you have 51% chance to drop item -_-
- Increased base damage formula a little, to make it easier with higher difficulty monsters
_________________________
v1.2.0 - 17 february 2015|
-------------------------|
- Inventory bug with changing tab is fixed!

- Strength increase your max backpack slots by 1 slot per 1 point in strength, base amout of slots is 100 -_- just for fun, testing etc.
- Item compare, hover over an item in your inventory, number next to item stats shows you how much of that stat you gain with that item, so (5) means + 5 and (-5) means you lose 5 of that stat upon equipping an item. I will work on something better soon
- Inventory slot display, check inventory tab.
_________________________
v1.1.9 - 16 february 2015|
-------------------------|
- Fixed a glitch with inventory items moving off screen when using Firefox
- Small bug fixes
- Upgrading luck, and increasing your drop rate, now affects how often you drop an item, starting at 50.5% increasing by 0.1% every point in luck, 
so you need 500 points in luck to have 100% drop rate, any more than this won't give any bonuses.
___________________________
v1.1.8.1 - 14 february 2015|
---------------------------|

- Currently no bonuses for leveling your sword(or any other weapon) level, but I plan to add some bonus stats for a starter, in the near future.
-!!!Current BUG!!! When you load a game, you need to unequip and equip items again to gain stats from them. While you have item equipped and you want to equip different item, you will need to
press equip button 2 times, because first click = unequip currently equipped item, and second click = equipping new item...I am still working on a solution to make it swap items automatically.
